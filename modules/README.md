# Notes on modulefiles

With GROMACS, I had to source the autocompletion files in my .bashrc due to not wanting to figure out how to convert them to valid modulefile language.

```
source /packages/gromacs/2016.1/bin/gmx-completion.bash
source /packages/gromacs/2016.1/bin/gmx-completion-gmx.bash
```
