Computer set-ups, shell environments, installation notes, etc.

[Go here for how to set up a new computer with Ubuntu 19.04](http://blog.minium.com.au/setup-ubuntu/)

[Go here for how to compile things](http://blog.minium.com.au/compile-programs/), e.g. funky versions of GROMACS, `g_mydensity`.

We have `.deb`s you can install here as well, providing it matches your computer's set-up.

Install one of them with:

```console
$ dpkg -i my_deb_package.deb
```

Remove one of them with:

```console
$ dpkg -r my_deb_package
```
